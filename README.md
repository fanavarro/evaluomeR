# What is it about? #

The **evaluomeR** package permits to evaluate the reliability of bioinformatic metrics by analysing
the stability and goodness of the classifications of such metrics. The method takes the measurements of 
the metrics for the dataset and evaluates the reliability of the metrics according to the 
following analyses: Correlations, Stability and Goodness of classifications.

Preferably, install **evaluomeR** from the latest stable version at the [release bioconductor repository](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/evaluomeR.html) or [development bioconductor repository](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/evaluomeR.html).
